# Garage-Fridge-Thermostat
ESP-01 code for garage fridge thermostat
If you have a refrigerator/freezer in your garage, it will not work properly in the winter months.  This project monitors the temperature of the fridge and freezer and turn the light bulb on in the refrigerator to keep the compartments at the proper temperature.  The standard temperature controls are not modified and will work as normal during the warmer months.
